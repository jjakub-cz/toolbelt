# üêö Bash Scripts

This folder contains various Bash scripts for Linux/macOS environments.

&nbsp;

## üìú Available Scripts

### `fconcat.sh`
Recursively traverses PATH (default ".") and merges the content of all files into OUTPUT (default "snapshot.txt"). For each file it prints the relative path followed by its content.
Handy when you need to paste multiple files into AI for example :-)

* Parameters:
    * `-h`  help
    * `-i`  dir/files to ignore (recursively), default empty
    * `-o`  output file, default ./snapshot.txt

* Example:
    * `fconcat.sh -o dump.txt -i .git,node_modules,dist src/`

### `dckrp.sh`
A lightweight CLI wrapper around common Docker Compose commands. Has a _completion_ as well.

* Features:
    - `dckrp` ‚Äì list all containers (`docker ps -a`)
    - `dckrp images [--clean]` - show image stats, optionally clean dangling images
    - `dckrp up` ‚Äì build and start the Compose project in the current directory
    - `dckrp down` ‚Äì stop and remove containers
    - `dckrp logs <container>` ‚Äì stream logs from a container
    - `dckrp exec <container> [cmd]` - execute command (default: /bin/bash) inside container
    - `dckrp clean` ‚Äì safely clean up unused containers, images, networks
    - `dckrp help` ‚Äì display help menu

* Usage:
    * Make the script executable and optionally create an alias:
        ```bash
        chmod +x dckrp.sh
        alias dckrp="/path/to/dckrp.sh"
        ```

* Completion:
    * Add to your `.bashrc` following line:
        ```bash
        source /path-to-completion-script/dckrp-completion.sh
        ```
    * ...and simply reload your `.bashrc` with `source ~/.bashrc`.
